# Git and Github
## Git and GitHub Basics
..* Git is a command line program which allows you to track versions of any code or plain text documents that you create. 
Like the “track changes” feature of a word processor Git keeps track of who made particular changes, the time and date of those changes, and where the changes were made. 
If a critical file gets deleted by accident, or if you make a breaking change to your code and you want to try to figure out where the breaking change was made, you can use Git to restore the deleted file or find the new bug in your program. 
Git organizes groups of files that you’re tracking into a repository, which is just a directory where all of the changes to files in that directory are tracked. Git can also help you collaborate with others when you’re writing software.
